Automations are created in Home Assistant via the UI, but are stored in a YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the `configuration.yaml` or `automations.yaml` files.

[\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/), select the automation, click on the menu button in the top right then on **Edit in YAML**.

The UI will write your automations to `automations.yaml`. This file is managed by the UI and should not be edited manually.

It is also possible to write your automations directly inside `configuration.yaml`The configuration.yaml file is the main configuration file for Home Assistant. It lists the integrations to be loaded and their specific configurations. In some cases, the configuration needs to be edited manually directly in the configuration.yaml file. Most integrations can be configured in the UI. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) or other YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language.

[\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) files. You can do this by adding a labeled `automation` block to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# The configuration required for the UI to work
automation: !include automations.yaml

# Labeled automation block
automation kitchen:
  - triggers:
      - trigger: ...
```

You can add as many labeled `automation` blocks as you want.

#### Configuration Variables

[Looking for your configuration file?](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/)

alias string (Optional)

Friendly name for the automation.

id string (Optional)

A unique id for your automation, will allow you to make changes to the name and entity\_id in the UI, and will enable debug traces.

description string (Optional)

A description of the automation.

initial\_state boolean (Optional, default: Restored from last run)

Used to define the state of your automation at startup. When not set, the state will be restored from the last run. See [Automation initial state](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/#automation-initial-state).

trace map (Optional, default: {})

Configuration values for the traces stored, currently only `stored_traces` can be configured.

stored\_traces integer (Optional, default: 5)

The number of traces which will be stored. See [Number of debug traces stored](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/#number-of-debug-traces-stored).

variables map (Optional, default: {})

Variables that will be available inside your templates, both in `conditions` and `actions`.

PARAMETER\_NAME any

The value of the variable. Any YAML is valid. Templates can also be used to pass a value to the variable.

trigger\_variables map (Optional, default: {})

Variables that will be available inside your [templates triggers](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#template-trigger).

PARAMETER\_NAME any

The value of the variable. Any YAML is valid. Only [limited templates](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/#limited-templates) can be used.

mode string (Optional, default: single)

Controls what happens when the automation is invoked while it is still running from one or more previous invocations. See [Automation modes](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/#automation-modes).

max integer (Optional, default: 10)

Controls maximum number of runs executing and/or queued up to run at a time. Only valid with modes `queued` and `parallel`.

max\_exceeded string (Optional, default: warning)

When `max` is exceeded (which is effectively 1 for `single` mode) a log message will be emitted to indicate this has happened. This option controls the severity level of that log message. See [Log Levels](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/#log-levels) for a list of valid options. Or `silent` may be specified to suppress the message from being emitted.

triggers listRequired

The trigger(s) which will start the automation. Multiple triggers can be added and the automation will start when any of these triggers trigger.

id string (Optional)

An ID that can be used in the automation to determine which trigger caused the automation to start.

variables map (Optional, default: {})

Variables that will be available in the conditions and action sequence.

PARAMETER\_NAME any

The value of the variable. Any YAML is valid. Templates can also be used to pass a value to the variable.

conditions list (Optional)

Conditions that have to be `true` to start the automation. By default all conditions listed have to be `true`, you can use [logical conditions](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/conditions/#logical-conditions) to change this default behavior.

actions listRequired

The sequence of actions to be performed in the script.

### Automation modes

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `single` | Do not start a new run. Issue a warning. |
| `restart` | Start a new run after first stopping previous run. |
| `queued` | Start a new run after all previous runs complete. Runs are guaranteed to execute in the order they were queued. |
| `parallel` | Start a new, independent run in parallel with previous runs. |

In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the `configuration.yaml` or `automations.yaml` files. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) based automation that you can add to `configuration.yaml`The configuration.yaml file is the main configuration file for Home Assistant. It lists the integrations to be loaded and their specific configurations. In some cases, the configuration needs to be edited manually directly in the configuration.yaml file. Most integrations can be configured in the UI. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/).

        target:
          entity_id: group.living_room

## Extra options

When writing automations directly in YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the `configuration.yaml` or `automations.yaml` files. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/), you will have access to advanced options that are not available in the user interface.

### Automation initial state

At startup, automations by default restore their last state of when Home Assistant ran. This can be controlled with the `initial_state` option. Set it to `false` or `true` to force initial state to be off or on.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Automation Name"
    initial_state: false
    triggers:
      - trigger: ...
```

### Number of debug traces stored

When using YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the `configuration.yaml` or `automations.yaml` files. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) you can configure the number of debugging traces stored for an automation. This is controlled with the `stored_traces` option under `trace`. Set `stored_traces` to the number of traces you wish to store for the particular automation. If not specified the default value of 5 will be used.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Automation Name"
    trace:
      stored_traces: 10
    triggers:
      - trigger: ...
```

## Migrating your YAML automations to automations.yaml

If you want to migrate your manual automations to use the editor, you’ll have to copy them to `automations.yaml`. Make sure that `automations.yaml` remains a list! For each automation that you copy over, you’ll have to add an `id`. This can be any string as long as it’s unique.

```yaml
# Example automations.yaml entry. Note, automations.yaml is always a list!
- id: my_unique_id  # <-- Required for editor to work, for automations created with the editor the id will be automatically generated.
  alias: "Hello world"
  triggers:
    - trigger: state
      entity_id: sun.sun
      from: below_horizon
      to: above_horizon
  conditions:
    - condition: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.temperature
      above: 17
      below: 25
      value_template: "{{ float(state.state) + 2 }}"
  actions:
    - action: light.turn_on
```

### Deleting automations

When automations remain visible in the Home Assistant dashboard, even after having deleted in the YAMLYAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the `configuration.yaml` or `automations.yaml` files. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) file, you have to delete them in the UI.

To delete them completely, go to UI [**Settings** \> **Devices & services** \> **Entities**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/entities) and find the automation in the search field or by scrolling down.

Check the square box aside of the automation you wish to delete and from the top-right of your screen, select ‘REMOVE SELECTED’.
