Automations support the advanced features of [templating](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/) in the same way as scripts do. In addition to the [Home Assistant template extensions](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/#home-assistant-template-extensions) available to scripts, the `trigger` and `this` template variables are available for automations.

Example of variables used in templates:

- `{{ this.name }}` is the name of the automation executing from this trigger
- `{{ trigger.platform }}` is the type of trigger object, like `calendar`

## Available state data

The template variable `this` is an object that contains the [state](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/state_object) of the automation at the moment of triggering the actions and can be used to evaluate [`trigger_variables`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#trigger-variables) declared in the configuration of the active triggerA trigger is a set of values or conditions of a platform that are defined to cause an automation to run. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/).
State objects also contain context data which can be used to identify the user that caused a scriptScripts are components that allow users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant when turned on. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/) or automationAutomations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/) to execute. Note that `this` will not change while executing the actionsActions are used in several places in Home Assistant. As part of a script or automation, actions define what is going to happen once a trigger is activated. In scripts, an action is called _sequence_. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/action/).

## Available trigger data

The template variable `trigger` is an object that contains details about which platformPlatforms are building blocks provided by some integrations to be used by other integrations. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/platform_options/) triggered the automation. The `platform` property contains the name of the platformPlatforms are building blocks provided by some integrations to be used by other integrations. [\[Learn more\]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/platform_options/) whose event triggered the automation.

Templates can use the data to modify the actions performed by the automation or displayed in a message. For example, you could create an automation that multiple sensors can trigger and then use the sensor’s location to specify a light to activate; or you could send a notification containing the friendly name of the sensor that triggered it.

Each [trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#event-trigger) platform includes additional data specific to that platformPlatforms are building blocks provided by some integrations to be used by other integrations.
