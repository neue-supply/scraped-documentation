The authentication system secures access to Home Assistant.

## Login screen

You are greeted with a log in screen, asking you for username and password.

## User accounts

When you start Home Assistant for the first time, the _owner_ user account is created. This account has some special privileges and can:

- Create and manage other user accounts.
- Configure integrations and other settings (coming soon).

Warning

For the moment, other user accounts will have the same access as the owner account. In the future, non-owner accounts will be able to have restrictions applied.

Note

If you want to manage users and you’re an owner but you do not see “Users” in your main configuration menu, make sure that **Advanced Mode** is enabled for your user in your profile.

### Your account profile

Once you’re logged in, you can see the details of your account on the [**User profile**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile) page by selecting on the circular at the very bottom of the sidebar.

You can:

- Change your password.
- Enable or disable [multi-factor authentication](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/multi-factor-auth/).
- Delete _Refresh Tokens_. These are created when you log in from a device. Delete them if you want to force the device to log out.
- Create [Long Lived Access Tokens](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token) so scripts can securely interact with Home Assistant.
- Define language and other locale settings.
- Log out of Home Assistant.

Note

Unused refresh tokens will be automatically removed. A refresh token is considered unused if it has not been used for a login within 90 days. If you need a permanent token, then we recommend using [Long Lived Access Tokens](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).

### Securing your login

_Make sure to choose a secure password!_ At some time in the future, you will probably want to access Home Assistant from outside your local network. This means you are also exposed to random black-hats trying to do the same. Treat the password like the key to your house.

As an extra level of security, you can turn on [multi-factor authentication](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/multi-factor-auth/).

## Adding a person to Home Assistant

If you have administrator rights, you can [add a person to Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/person/#adding-a-person-to-home-assistant) and create them a user account.

## Changing display or username

To learn how to change a display or username, refer to [setting up basic information](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/).

## Other authentication techniques

Home Assistant provides several ways to authenticate. See the [Auth providers](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/) section.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication failures from 127.0.0.1

If you’re seeing authentication failures from `127.0.0.1` and you’re using the `nmap` device tracker, you should [exclude the Home Assistant IP](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nmap_tracker#exclude) from being scanned.

### Bearer token warnings

Under the new authentication system you’ll see the following warning logged when the [legacy API password](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#legacy-api-password) is supplied, but not configured in Home Assistant:

```txt
WARNING (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.http.auth] You need to use a bearer token to access /blah/blah from 192.0.2.4
```

Txt

Copy

If you see this, you need to add an [`api_password`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#api_password) to your `http:` configuration.

### Bearer token informational messages

If you see the following, then this is a message for integration developers, to tell them they need to update how they authenticate to Home Assistant. As an end user you don’t need to do anything:

```txt
INFO (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.http.auth] You need to use a bearer token to access /blah/blah from 192.0.2.4
```

Txt

Copy

### Lost owner password

If you lose the password associated with the owner account, you need to [start a new onboarding process](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/locked_out/#to-prepare-the-system-to-start-a-new-onboarding-process).

### Error: invalid client id or redirect URL

![Screenshot of Error: invalid client id or redirect url](https://www.home-assistant.io/images/docs/authentication/error-invalid-client-id.png)

You have to use a domain name, not IP address, to remote access Home Assistant otherwise you will get `Error: invalid client id or redirect url` error on the login form. However, you can use the IP address to access Home Assistant in your home network.

This is because we only allow an IP address as a client ID when your IP address is an internal network address (e.g., `192.168.0.1`) or loopback address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).

If you don’t have a valid domain name for your Home Assistant instance, you can modify the `hosts` file on your computer to fake one.
On Linux edit the `/etc/hosts` file, and add following entry:

```text
12.34.56.78 homeassistant.home
```

Text

Copy

Replace `12.34.56.78` with your Home Assistant’s public IP address.

This will allow you to open Home Assistant at `http://homeassistant.home:8123/`

### Stuck on loading data

Some ad blocking software, such as Wipr, also blocks WebSockets. If you’re stuck on the Loading data screen, try disabling your ad blocker.
