The Home Assistant [frontend integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/) provides the graphical user interface that allows you to browse and control the state of your house, manage automations, and configure integrations.

Home Assistant comes with a [default dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/dashboards/#home-assistant-default-dashboards). But you can also create and customize your own dashboards.

- [Views](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/views/)
- [Dashboard cards](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/cards/)
- [Badges](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/badges/)
- [Themes](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/)

## User- or browser-dependent settings, general settings

### User- or browser-dependent settings

Some of the frontend settings depend on the user. Other settings can be set by client. This allows you for example to have different languages per user, and a different theme depending on the device that is used to display Home Assistant.

To change these settings, in the bottom left, select your username to open your [**User profile**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile).

- To change general settings such as language, number and time format, go to the **User settings**.
- To change browser dependent settings such as the theme, default dashboard, or whether or not to show the sidebar, change the **Browser settings**.

### Themes

Themes can be set per browser. In the [**User profile**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile), you can define some theme settings, such as whether you want a light or dark theme. However, more detailed theme settings require YAML configuration. Refer to the documentation of the [frontend integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/).

### General settings

Some of the settings, such as location and currency, were defined during the onboarding process. They can be changed under [**Settings** \> **System** \> **General**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/general). Refer to the documentation on [setup basic information](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/).

## Apps for Android and iOS

If you are looking for information on Home Assistant for Android or iOS, refer to the [documentation for the Companion Apps](https://companion.home-assistant.io/).
