This section will help you set up Assist, which is Home Assistant voice assistant.
Assist allows you to control Home Assistant using natural language. It is built on top of an open voice foundation and powered by knowledge provided by our community.
The simplest way to try out Assist is inside our companion app. Look for the Assist icon at the top right of your dashboard.
The simplest way to get started with Assist is with our recommended voice assistant hardware, the [Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/).
As for the rest of Home Assistant core functionalities, Assist can be personalized and extended to fit your needs.
  * It can work locally or leverage the greatest LLMs of the moment.
  * It can work on your phone or tablet or other custom voice devices.


## Getting started 
When you configure voice assistant hardware made for Home Assistant, it will use a wizard to help you configure your system and get started to use voice.
Our recommended voice assistant hardware is the [Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/).
In case your hardware does not support our wizard, do not worry. Here are two detailed guides based on how you plan to process your voice (Locally, or using Home Assistant Cloud voice services)
  * [I plan to process my voice locally](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant/)
  * [I plan to use Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/voice_remote_cloud_assistant/) (recommended as it is the simplest)


## Expand and experiment 
Once your setup is up and running and you follow the [best practices](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/best_practices), check all the possibilities we found for [Expanding your Assist setup](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/expanding_assist), and further experiment with different setups like [wake words](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/about_wake_word/). Do you want to talk to Super Mario? Or another figure? If you want Assist to respond in a fun way, you can create an assistant with an [AI personality](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/).
Another things you can do to further push your setup:
  * Voice assistant devices allow you to add Assist to a room and respond to wake words. Follow our tutorial to [create your own for just $13.](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/)
  * You can use [ESPHome](https://www.esphome.io/components/voice_assistant.html) to create your own awesome voice assistant, like [@piitaya](https://github.com/piitaya) did with his 3D printed R5 droid:
  * If you are interested in a voice assistant that is not always listening, consider using Assist on an analog phone. It will only listen when you pick up the horn, and the responses are for your ears only. Follow our tutorial to create your own [analog phone voice assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/).
