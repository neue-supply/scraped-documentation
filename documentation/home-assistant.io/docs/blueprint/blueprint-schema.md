## The blueprint schema 
Blueprint schemas currently supports three types of schema depending on its domain: [`automation`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/); `script`; and [`template`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#using-blueprints).
The configuration schema of a blueprint consists of 2 parts:
  1. The blueprint’s high-level metadata: name, domain and, optionally, any input required from the user.
  2. The schema for the blueprint domain it describes.


The first part is referred to as the _blueprint schema_. It contains the blueprint’s metadata.
Minimum required metadata for a blueprint is its name and domain. In its most basic form, a blueprint looks like:
```
blueprint:
  name: Example blueprint
  domain: automation
```

YAML
Copy
Although this is a valid blueprint, it is not very useful.
The second part depends on its domain, the type of blueprint. For example, when creating a blueprint for an automation, the full schema for an [automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/) applies.
This is the full blueprint schema:
####  Configuration Variables 
[Looking for your configuration file?](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/)
name string Required
The name of the blueprint. Keep this short and descriptive.
description string (Optional
The description of the blueprint. While optional, this field is highly recommended. Describe what the blueprint does and describe the inputs the blueprint requires. The description can include [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
domain string Required
The domain in which this blueprint is used. Currently, only three types, [`automation`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/yaml/), `script` and [`template`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#using-blueprints) are supported.
author string (Optional
The name of the blueprint author.
homeassistant map (Optional
Home Assistant version required for the blueprint to work successfully.
min_version string (Optional
Minimum required version of Home Assistant to use the blueprint in the format of _major_._minor_._patch_ (all parts are required). For example, `2022.4.0`. It is important to set this if the blueprint uses any features introduced in recent releases to head off issues.
input map (Optional
A dictionary of defined user inputs or sections. These are the input fields that the consumer of your blueprint can provide using YAML definition, or via a configuration form in the UI. Sections provide a way to visually group a set of related inputs (see below).
### Blueprint inputs 
A blueprint can accept one or multiple inputs from the user, but does not require any input.
These inputs can be of any type (string, boolean, list, map). They can have a default value and also provide a [selector](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/) that ensures a matching input field in the user interface.
A blueprint input has the following configuration:
####  Configuration Variables 
[Looking for your configuration file?](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/)
name string (Optional
The name of the input field.
description string (Optional
A short description of the input field. Keep this short and descriptive. The description can include [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
selector  (Optional
The [selector](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/) to use for this input. A selector defines how the input is displayed in the frontend UI.
default any (Optional
The default value of this input, in case the input is not provided by the user of this blueprint.
Each input field can be referred to, outside of the blueprint metadata, using the `!input` custom YAML tag before its name.
The following example shows a minimal _blueprint schema_ with a single input:
```
blueprint:
  name: Example blueprint
  description: Example showing an input
  domain: automation
  input:
    my_input:
      name: Example input
```

YAML
Copy
In the above example, `my_input` is the identifier of the input. It can be referenced by using the `!input my_input` custom tag.
In this example, no [`selector`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/) was provided. In the user interface, a text input field would be shown to the user. It is then up to the user to find out what to enter there. Blueprints that come with [selectors](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/) are easier to use.
A blueprint can have as many inputs as you like.
### Blueprint input sections 
One or more input sections can be added under the main `input` key. Each section visually groups the inputs in that section, allows an optional description, and optionally allows for collapsing those inputs. Note that the section only impacts how inputs are displayed to the user when they fill in the blueprint. Inputs must have unique names and be referenced directly by their name; not by section and name.
A section is differentiated from an input by the presence of an additional `input` key within that section.
Input sections are a new feature in version 2024.6.0. Set the `min_version` for the blueprint to at least this version if using input sections. Otherwise, the blueprint will generate errors on older versions. See [this section](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/schema/#min_version) for more details.
The full configuration for an input section is below:
####  Configuration Variables 
[Looking for your configuration file?](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/)
name string (Optional
A name for the section. If omitted the key of the section is used.
icon string (Optional
An icon to display next to the name of the section.
description string (Optional
An optional description of this section, which will be displayed at the top of the section. The description can include [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
collapsed boolean (Optional, default: false)
If `true`, the section will be collapsed by default. Useful for optional or less important inputs. All collapsed inputs must also have a defined `default` before they can be hidden.
input map Required
A dictionary of defined user inputs within this section.
The following example shows a _blueprint schema_ with some inputs in a section:
```
blueprint:
  name: Example sections blueprint
  description: Example showing a section
  input:
    base_input:
      name: An input not in the section
    my_section:
      name: My Section
      icon: mdi:cog
      description: These options control a specific feature of this blueprint
      input:
        my_input:
          name: Example input
        my_input_2:
          name: 2nd example input
```

### Blueprint inputs in templates 
The inputs are available as custom YAML tags, but not as template variables. To use a blueprint input in a template, it first needs to be exposed as either a [script level variable](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script/#configuration-variables) or in a [variable script step](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/#variables).
```
variables:
  # Make input my_input available as a script level variable
  my_input: !input my_input
```

### Example blueprints 
The [built-in blueprints](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/automation/blueprints) are great examples to get a bit of a feeling of how blueprints work.
Here is the built-in motion light automation blueprint. Note the _blueprint schema_ under the blueprint key is followed by its domain schema. In this example, an automation schema.
```
blueprint:
  name: Motion-activated Light
  description: Turn on a light when motion is detected.
  domain: automation
  input:
    motion_entity:
      name: Motion Sensor
      selector:
        entity:
          filter:
            device_class: motion
            domain: binary_sensor
    light_target:
      name: Light
      selector:
        target:
          entity:
            domain: light
    no_motion_wait:
      name: Wait time
      description: Time to leave the light on after last motion is detected.
      default: 120
      selector:
        number:
          min: 0
          max: 3600
          unit_of_measurement: seconds

# If motion is detected within the delay,
# we restart the script.
mode: restart
max_exceeded: silent

triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: !input motion_entity
    from: "off"
    to: "on"

actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target: !input light_target
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: !input motion_entity
        from: "on"
        to: "off"
  - delay: !input no_motion_wait
  - action: light.turn_off
    target: !input light_target
```
