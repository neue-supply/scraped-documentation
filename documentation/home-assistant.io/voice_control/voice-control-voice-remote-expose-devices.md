To be able to control your devices over a voice command, you must expose your entities to Assist. This is to avoid that sensitive devices, such as locks and garage doors, can inadvertently be controlled by voice commands.
## Exposing your devices to Assist 
  1. Go to **Settings** > **Voice assistants**.
  2. Open the **Expose** tab. 
  3. To control the settings for a specific entity, select the entity from the list.
     * In the pop-up, select all assistants to which the entity should be exposed to: Assist, Google Assistant, and/or Alexa. 
  4. To expose multiple entities at once, to all the assistants, select the **Expose entities** button
  5. Select all entities you want to be able to control by voice.
